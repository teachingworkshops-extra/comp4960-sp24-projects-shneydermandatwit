# Rate My Wit

Welcome to Rate My Wit, a project by The Reviewers!

## Overview

### Introduction

Our application will be a collaborative platform for WIT students and faculty to virtually explore campus amenities. Users will have the ability to share their reviews on campus amenities and request to add new locations on the map.

### Purpose 

Students may be unaware of amenities, and their quality, on campus, such as gyms, bathrooms, or places to eat. There is currently no community driven platform for Wentworth, and this product aims to fill that gap. Rate My WIT will provide this community with realistic information about campus amenities provided by their own peers.

### Functionality 

The application provides an interactive map centered on the WIT campus with preset map markers for each of the main WIT-owned campus buildings. Users will be able to create an account and make contributions to the site by writing reviews for specific locations on campus within these buildings.
